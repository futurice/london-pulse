# ðŸŒŸ London Pulse Results ðŸŒŸ

A visualisation of pulse data for the London tribe only to help analyse results and facilitate monthly discussions:

* How do tribes compare to each other? (high's & low's)
* How does our own tribe compare to others?
* How does one tribe compare with itself month by month?
* Responses distribution per question, per month, just because.

CSV data is from https://pulse-results.app.futurice.com
Note: this project uses Foundation with the ZURB Template (http://foundation.zurb.com/sites).
